# Traffic Light Simulation

## About the Project
This project is a simple **Traffic Light Simulation** built using React and styled for a beginner-friendly UI. The traffic light cycles through the colors **green**, **yellow**, and **red** at specified intervals:
- **Green**: 3 seconds
- **Yellow**: 2 seconds
- **Red**: 5 seconds

The cycle repeats indefinitely without user interaction. The app is deployed and accessible [here](https://amazing-halva-0dc5ce.netlify.app/).

- **Responsive Design**: The traffic light layout adapts well to different screen sizes.
- **Beginner-Friendly Code**: Simple and optimized code using React hooks for state and lifecycle management.
